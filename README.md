# Sentiment-Analysis
Sentimenytal Analysis of Twitter Data  using Logistic Regression Model
This is a simple sentiment analysis project that uses a logistic regression model to classify text as either positive or negative. The model is trained on a dataset of Twitter and can be used to classify any piece of text as positive or negative.

## Installation
To run this project, you'll need to have Python 3 installed. You can clone the repository and install the necessary packages using pip:
git clone [https://github.com/aadarsh-khirwal/sentiment-analysis.git](https://github.com/aadarsh-khirwal/sentiment_analysis/tree/main)
cd Sentiment-Analysis
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
Once you have installed the required packages, you can run the project by running the following command:
python app.py
This will start the web server, and you can access the application by visiting http://localhost:5000 in your web browser.

## Dataset
The dataset used to train the model is the Twitter Dataset provided by "nltk". The dataset contains 11,339 twitter samples labeled as either positive or negative.

## Model
The model used in this project is a logistic regression model. Logistic regression is a type of classification algorithm that is used to predict the probability of a categorical dependent variable. In this case, the dependent variable is whether a piece of text is positive or negative.

## Results
The model achieves an accuracy of around 99% on the test set. This is a reasonably good accuracy for a sentiment analysis model, considering that human agreement on sentiment labeling is typically around 80%.
